# Glossary


## Blockchain

> A blockchain is a distributed, chronological database of transactions.
> This database is shared and maintained across nodes that participate in a peer-to-peer network.
> Transactions are packaged into blocks which are linked to one another as a chain.
 
Popular blockchain platforms:

- [Bitcoin]( https://bitcoin.org)
- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org)
- [EOS](https://eos.io) 
- [POA](https://www.poa.network) 
- [Nxt](https://www.jelurida.com/nxt)
- [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric)
 
## Transactions

> Adding transactions to a blockchain requires confirmation from several nodes of the network, which all abide to a certain consensus protocol.
 
## Proof of work (PoW) 

> PoW is a consensus protocol which requires nodes to solve a hard mathematical puzzle.
 
The computing power required to solve the puzzle ensures that tampering with the data is infeasible. 
Ensures that there is no better strategy to find a solution to the puzzle than enumerating all the possibilities (i.e., brute force).
On the other hand, verification of a solution is trivial and cheap.

## Ethereum

> Ethereum is the largest programmable blockchain platform. It is also a novel application development platform.

## Smart contracts

> Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralised application (DApps).

- Despite its name, they are general-purpose computing programs.
- Solidity is the most popular programming language to write smart contracts.

## DApps

> DApps are smart contracts used to implement the backend of a certain application.

## Client

> A client is an implementation of Ethereum that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.
- 
- What these implementations have in common is they all follow a formal specification. This specification dictates how the Ethereum network and blockchain functions.
- Clients can run 3 different types of node : light, full and archive.

## Token

> Tokens represent digital assets that ca be traded, including everything from commodities to voting rights.

Every token has a name and an acronym or symbol, and any smart contract can define a new token. 
It is common for tokens to represent money. 
Therefore, in practice, (crypto)coins and tokens are frequently used interchangeably.

## Token contract

> Token contracts are special smart contracts that define a token and keep track of its balance across user accounts.
 
Ethereum has two main technical standards for the implementation of tokens, known as the ERC20 interface and the ERC721 inter- face.
The standardization allows contracts to operate on different tokens seamlessly, while also fostering interoperability between contracts.

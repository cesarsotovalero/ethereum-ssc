# Glossary


### Ethereum

Ethereum is the largest programmable blockchain platform. It is also a novel application development platform.


### Smart contracts

Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralised application (Dapps). Despite its name, they are general-purpose computing programs (Solidity is the most popular language).


### Client

A client is an implementation of Ethereum that verifies all transactions in each block, keeping the network secure and the data accurate.

What these implementations have in common is they all follow a formal specification. This specification dictates how the Ethereum network and blockchain functions.

Clients can run 3 different types of node : light, full and archive
